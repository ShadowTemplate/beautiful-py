A collection of Java-like implementations of design patterns. These patterns 
are described in the book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable 
Object-Oriented Software* by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John 
Vlissides (ISBN 978-0201633610).

You can find a synthesis of each pattern together with examples 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o7m-jBeclKQAuDBIUax2t7brjB1HOLvHq-EUv-FF_AE/edit?usp=sharing).

Patterns are grouped by purpose, but some interesting examples of combined 
usage are also provided.
